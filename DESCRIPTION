Description: The goal of 'ggcoverage' is to simplify the process of visualizing genome/protein coverage. It contains functions to 
    load data from BAM, BigWig, BedGraph or txt/xlsx files, create genome/protein coverage plot, add various annotations to 
    the coverage plot, including base and amino acid annotation, GC annotation, gene annotation, transcript annotation, ideogram annotation,
    peak annotation, contact map annotation, link annotation and peotein feature annotation.
